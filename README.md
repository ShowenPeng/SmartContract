# Basic Sample Hardhat Smart Contract Project

This demonstrates a basic Hardhat Smart Contract Project. It comes with some sample contracts, some tests for those contracts, some sample scripts that deploy those contracts, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
